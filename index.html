      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <pre>Adam Kabbara:  <em>Welcome!</em> I would like to introduce myself.</pre>
      <p>Throughout my journey into Computer Science, I have found many subject
        that interest me. One being <span class="red-pop">Machine Learning</span>. I have written a few different prediction algorithms such as KNN,
        Boosting and Decision Trees to name a few. <span class="red-pop">Web Development</span> has also sparked an interest for me. We can do so much
        with the internet. I have taken this to my advantage and worked on games for entertainment and tools that developers can
        utilize.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On this site, you are able to learn more about me and see the projects I have worked on. The navbar on top can help 
          assist you to navigate around this site while trying to learn more about me. Feel free to contact me, the navbar 
          contains a link to send me an email. <i>Enjoy!</i> &#x1F642;</p>
